# E-Commerce Sales Visualization

A dynamic and interactive visualization tool designed to celebrate every sale made on an e-commerce platform. Each sale triggers a bubble animation containing the product image, rising from the bottom to the top of the screen.

## Features

- **Real-time Animation**: Bubbles appear in real-time as sales occur.
- **Responsive**: Narrow visualization container ensures that the bubbles are visible and impactful on all screen sizes.
- **Randomized Movement**: Each bubble not only rises but also has a subtle randomized X-axis movement, ensuring a natural and organic feel.

## How it Works

- The project utilizes vanilla JavaScript to simulate sales and trigger the bubble animations.
- CSS3 animations power the bubbles' rise and lateral movement.
- The project can be integrated with real-time sales data using WebSockets or AJAX polling to fetch sales data and trigger animations accordingly.
